Eagle Mode is an advanced solution for a futuristic style of man-machine
communication in which the user can visit almost everything simply by zooming
in. It has a professional file manager, file viewers and players for most of the
common file types, a chess game, a 3D mines game, a netwalk game, a
multi-function clock and some fractal fun, all integrated in a virtual cosmos.
Besides, that cosmos also provides a Linux kernel configurator in form of a
kernel patch.
